## Changelog
## v3.0.2

* Fixed Eve optimized options on Reliant and Swivel engines for KSP 1.12.2+
* Deleted old deprecated parts.

## Description

Eve Optimized Engines provides low expansion ratio variants of six of the game's most popular engines - Swivel, Reliant, Spark, Thud, Skipper and Mainsail. These variants provide greatly improved high ambient pressure performance, which comes by sacrificing low-pressure performance. When operating on Kerbin or in space, stick with the stock engines. But when launching from the surface of Eve, the modified engines provide good first stage power and performance.

## Requirements

[ModuleManager](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager/releases)

[B9 Part Switch](https://github.com/blowfishpro/B9PartSwitch/releases)

## Optional

An optional config is provided that decreases nozzle expansion ratios further for use on planets with even higher atmospheric pressures. It is designed for use with mods such as [Realistic Atmospheres](https://github.com/OhioBob/Realistic-Atmospheres/releases) or [JNSQ](https://github.com/Galileo88/JNSQ/releases), which increase Eve's sea level pressure to 10 atm.

## Installation Instructions

1. Download Eve Optimized Engines v3.0.2.

2. Copy from [Download]\GameData\ to [KSP]\GameData\ the folder EveEngines and all its contents.
